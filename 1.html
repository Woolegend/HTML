  <strong>[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]</strong><br>
  I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
  I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
  I Know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you<br>
  I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)<br>
  </p><p style = "margin-top: 40px;">
  <strong>[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]</strong><br>
  I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
  I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
  I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
  Oh, I’ll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
  </p><p style = "margin-top: 40px;">
  <strong>[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]</strong><br>
  Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
  Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
  Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
  Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>

  <strong>[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]</strong><br>
  When I’m away from you, I miss your touch (Ooh)<br>
  You’re the reason I believe in love<br>
  It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)<br>
  And I’m afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
  Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
  'Cause you ain’t ever left me empty-handed<br>
  And you know that I know that I can't live without you<br>
  So, baby, stay<br>
